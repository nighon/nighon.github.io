反向代理缓存。

For a project we're working on at Spatie we're expecting high traffic. That's why we spent some time researching how to improve the request speed of a Laravel application and the amount of requests a single server can handle. There are many strategies and services you can use to speed up a site. In our specific project one of the things we settled on is Varnish. In this post I'd like to share how to set up Varnish on a Forge provisioned server.

我们当前正在完成 Spatie 的一个项目，希望实现高并发。因此我们花一些时间去研究如何提高 Laravel 应用在单个服务器上能处理的的请求速度和请求数量。有很多策略和服务可以用来提升站点。在我们这个项目中，我们解决的其中一件事情就是 Varnish。在这篇文章中，我想和大家分享如何在一台用 Forge 搭建的服务器上部署 Varnish。

High level overview
First, let's discuss what Varnish does. Varnish calls itself a caching HTTP reverse proxy. Basically that means that instead of a webserver listening for requests, Varnish will listen for them. When a request comes in the first time it will pass it on to the webserver. The webserver will do its work as usual and send a response back to Varnish. Varnish will cache that response and send it back to the visitor of the site. The next time the same request comes in Varnish will just serve up it's cached response. The webserver (and PHP/Laravel) won't even be started up. This results in a dramatic increase in performance.

### Over SSL

Out of the box Varnish can't handle https connections, so you'll need to do some extra configurating to make it work.

**默认配置的 Varnish 无法处理 https 链接，因此你需要做一些额外的工作使之生效。**
